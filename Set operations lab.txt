Set Operations Lab Questions
(6 points) Let A = {a, b, c, d, e}, B = {c, e, f, g}, and C = {b, d, e, h}. Find:
a) A - B
b) B - A
c) (A - B) ∪ (B - A)
d) (A - C) ∩ B
e) A - (B ∩ C)
f) A ⊕ B 
(5 points) Prove the following set identity by showing that the Left-Hand Side (LHS) is equal to the Right-Hand Side (RHS): A ∩ (B ∪ C) = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)
(5 points) Consider sets X, Y, and Z.
a) Prove that if X ⊆ Y, then X - Y = ∅ (the empty set).
b) Prove the identity: X - (Y ∩ Z) = (X - Y) ∪ (X - Z)
(5 points) Let A and B be sets. Prove the following identity: A = (A ∩ B) ∪ (A - B)
(5 points) In a survey of students:
60 students are in the Math Club
40 students are in the Computer Club
20 students are in both clubs
a) How many students are in the Math Club only?
b) How many students are in the Computer Club only?
c) How many students are in either the Math Club or the Computer Club but not both? (Use set difference to help solve)
6. (5 points) Prove the following set identity using the identities from the image. Show each step and state the identity used:
(A ∪ B) ∩ (A ∪ B') = A
